## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally got to learn and use CSS Grid in a project. Big thanks to [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) for his wonderful speech in the Laravel conf on CSS Grid, it really helped me with understanding CSS Grid.

I also got to use the new CSS `margin-inline` property in this project.

See how I used it below:

```css
.container {
  width: 84%;
  max-width: 1110px;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
```

```css
.attribution {
  position: relative;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing and building more projects using CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid in 45 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCZdCKjnBCs) - This video by [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoebwHSTvwalADTJhps0emA) over on YouTube helped me apply and refresh my knowledge of CSS Grid. I really like the way he makes it simple to understand and remember all in 45 minutes.
